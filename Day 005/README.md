## Description

"Statistic ðŸ“Š" is a web-based dashboard that presents visual statistics using HTML and CSS. It provides an intuitive interface to display revenue data in a graphical format. The project utilizes SVG graphics and custom styling to create an engaging data visualization experience.

## Features

- **Monthly Report Display**: The dashboard showcases a monthly revenue report with information such as the title, revenue type, date range, and revenue amount.

- **Graphical Representation**: The dashboard features two data sets represented as line graphs. The red graph represents the number of views, while the blue graph represents the number of purchases.

- **Interactive Data Points**: Each data point on the graphs is interactive. Hovering over a data point displays a tooltip with relevant information.

- **Responsive Design**: The dashboard is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

## Implementation Details

- The dashboard is built using HTML and styled with CSS.
- The interactive graphs use SVG and CSS animations.
- Tooltips are implemented with CSS and JavaScript for interactivity.

## Challenges Faced

While developing this project, I encountered challenges in positioning and styling the SVG-based graphs to achieve a cohesive design. Additionally, fine-tuning the animations for a seamless user experience was a key consideration.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate more data visualization techniques, such as line charts or pie charts.
- Implement data fetching from external sources to make the dashboard dynamic.
- Enhance responsiveness for various screen sizes and devices.
