- Stylish "Back to Home" button for quick navigation.

## Technologies Used

## Implementation Details

- The header includes a navigation bar with links to Home, Products, About, and Contact sections.
- The circular element on the left is created using a combination of CSS properties and the `clip-path` property.
- The image is displayed on the left side and is styled to fit within the circular element.
- The "404" text and the error message are positioned on the right side.
- The "Back to Home" button is styled with a border, background, and appropriate text color.

## Responsive Design

The page is responsive and adjusts its layout for different screen sizes. On smaller screens, the circular element and image take up the full width, and the content is stacked vertically for improved readability.
