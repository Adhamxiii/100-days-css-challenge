# 100 Days CSS Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days CSS Challenge repository! In this challenge, I'm taking on the creative journey of writing CSS snippets for 100 consecutive days. Through this challenge, I aim to enhance my CSS skills, explore design concepts, and share my progress with the community.

## What is the 100 Days CSS Challenge?

The 100 Days CSS Challenge is a personal project where I commit to crafting CSS snippets for 100 consecutive days. Each day, I'll create a new snippet and share it here. This challenge serves as a platform for me to learn, practice, and exhibit my evolving CSS prowess.

## Repository Structure

- Each day's CSS snippet is organized in its own folder, labeled as `DayXXX`, corresponding to the day number.
- Inside each folder, you'll find the CSS file for that day's snippet.
- I'll provide a brief description in the `README.md` file within each day's folder, outlining the concept, design, and any challenges I encountered during the day's work.
