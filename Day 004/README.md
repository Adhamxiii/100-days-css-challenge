## Description

This project features a visually appealing animation of concentric circles that expand and contract with an alternating shadow effect. The animation is created using HTML and CSS, and it's a great example of how CSS animations can be utilized to add engaging visual effects to web content.

## Implementation Details

- The animation is crafted using HTML and CSS.
- Each circle has its own set of keyframes to control its expansion and contraction.
- Cubic-bezier easing is used to achieve a more unique and dynamic motion.

## Challenges Faced

During the development of this snippet, I encountered challenges in fine-tuning the timing of the animation and ensuring that the shadow changes add depth without overwhelming the design.

## Further Improvements

- Experiment with different cubic-bezier values to explore diverse animation effects.
- Combine this dynamic animation with other elements to create more intricate scenes.
- Optimize the animation timings and easing functions to achieve a smoother and more captivating effect.
